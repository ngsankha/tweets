This is an archive of my tweets from [@sankha93](https://twitter.com/sankha93) on Twitter.  
Because of the limitation that you cannot retrieve anything older than 3200 tweets ever. So I got an archive of my tweets right here.

You can read my [blog post](http://thelimbeck.wordpress.com/2012/06/30/aggressively-probing-twitter-habits/) about this repo as well as how to get certain stats about my Twitter usage.

Inspired by [holman/tweets](https://github.com/holman/tweets), but does not depend on Madrox. This archive was generated by [this](https://gist.github.com/2857462).

All great things have an end so did this. This repo is closed and not updated anymore. You can read more about it on [my blog](http://thelimbeck.wordpress.com/2012/11/15/the-end-of-my-tweets-repository/).
